   i. SetupScript\BIDSHelperSetup2014.nsi ($PRODUCT_VERSION variable)

2. Exclude any files still being worked on from the solution

3. Build the Solution, or just check in and TeamCity will build the next release the next night.

4. Build the install

5. Label the file in the SCC system with the release version number

6. Add the files back that were excluded from the project in step 2.
